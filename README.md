# LeadMeLabs---HostingServer-Station

The LeadMe Labs Station Hosting Server is specifically designed to support the LeadMe Labs Station software and its 
associated widgets, including SteamCMD and SetVol. Please note that direct communication with this server is not intended 
or recommended. Instead, it is advisable to make a URL call to the main Redirect server, which will efficiently redirect 
the request to the hosting server.

### Purpose and Benefits
The primary objective of implementing this hosting server architecture is to enhance security and ensure a reliable 
service. By centralizing the communication through the Redirect server, we minimize the risk of individual servers 
experiencing downtime. Additionally, this setup provides the following advantages:

- Security: The redirection approach helps safeguard the hosting server from potential vulnerabilities and unauthorized 
- access.
- Scalability: The design allows for easy expansion in the future, enabling seamless swapping or changing of applications 
- as per project requirements.
- Flexibility: By decoupling the direct contact with the hosting server, we maintain the flexibility to update or upgrade 
- the infrastructure without disrupting the overall system functionality.

### Usage Instructions
To utilize the LeadMe Labs Station Hosting Server effectively, follow these steps:

Make sure you have the necessary access credentials and permissions to interact with the Redirect server.
Use the appropriate URL call to the Redirect server, providing the required parameters or data for the LeadMe Labs 
Station software.
The Redirect server will intelligently route the request to the hosting server, which will process the necessary actions 
and respond accordingly.
Receive the response from the hosting server via the Redirect server and handle it appropriately in your application.
Additional Notes
- It is crucial to maintain the security and integrity of the hosting server by adhering to the recommended communication 
- approach through the Redirect server.
- Any updates or changes to the LeadMe Labs Station software or associated widgets should be managed in a controlled 
- manner, considering the potential impact on the hosting server and other related components.
